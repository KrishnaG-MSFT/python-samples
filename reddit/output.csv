b'Azure Conditional Access Question for office Apps blocks',"b'Hello, I setup a conditional access policy to only allow email inside our network, if they try to access email outside our network it will block them.  The issue I am having is that our locations have DHCP set on the modems and they are constantly changing, so I have to update Trusted locations on a daily basis.  Is there another way to actually be able to block email outside the network without using Trusted Locations?     \n\n\nOne scenario I thought of is that the devices are managed by Intune but the user to logon to the device is not the same user who needs to access email since it is a shared device.  I was looking at using trusted devices but since the email user is not the same as the logon account, how would I go about and implement this CA policy?    \n\n\nThanks in advance'",Technical Question,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/l18uw4/azure_conditional_access_question_for_office_apps/'

b'Autopilot Azure AD Hybrid Join - Windows upgrade issue',"b'After a couple of weeks of fiddling I managed to hybrid join a Dell test device through autopilot. We have a configuration profile set up in intune to upgrade the devices from Windows 10 Pro to Enterprise, but when the profile is successfully applied to the device it loses connection to our domain AD. I noticed this when trying to apply a group policy and running the gpupdate /force command, resulting in the following error:\n\n""*Computer policy could not be updated successfully. The following errors were encountered:*\n\n*The processing of Group Policy failed because of lack of network connectivity to a domain controller. This may be a transient condition. A success message would be generated once the machine gets connected to the domain controller and Group Policy has successfully processed. If you do not see a success message for several hours, then contact your administrator.*""\n\nI disabled the profile and manually downgraded back to Windows 10 Pro by entering a generic key making the gpo apply successfully without any errors. When upgrading back to Enterprise (manually as well to see if the profile itself was causing issues) the same error occurs. I tried hybrid joining a second device through autopilot, also with the same configuration profile, and that ended up also losing connection.\n\nI spent almost all day yesterday googling, trying to find an answer without any success.\n\nWe have a large batch of new devices coming in a couple of months that needs to be hybrid joined, stable and running Windows 10 Enterprise so I would greatly appreciate any advice you can give!'",Support Issue,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/l143xl/autopilot_azure_ad_hybrid_join_windows_upgrade/'

b'Planning to Migrate to Azure...which workloads make sense first?',"b'First thank you all for the continuous advice on this forum over the past 4 months. You\'ve all been a lot of help!\n\nI\'ve been testing different Azure solutions and ideas for the past 3 months.  The plan is to migrate as many on-prem workloads over to Azure by end of this year.  Because of covid, my company is planning to move to a smaller office sometime in early 2022.  Currently everyone is working remotely and even when we move into the new office, we expect only around 20 people in the office a day while the rest of the people work from home.  \n\nHeadquarters workloads/services (not including monitoring/backup/antivirus/IDS/IPS etc):\n\nA) 2 win 2019 Domain Controllers; 1 win 2019 Read only DC for RADIUS Authentication (3 total) with typical DC services like DNS, DHCP, etc.\n\nB) 1 File store (we have more file stores at other branch offices, but they are much smaller)\n\nC) Sharepoint 2013 which I HATE but the guy before me spent all his time developing in SP2013 and so many company processes that are tied into SP 2013...SQL is local to the server.\n\nD) Budgeting, forecasting Apps and our ERP are tied into SQL.  Because of our ERP which is Epicor, if we migrated to Azure it would have to be a ""lift and shift"" operation as using a SQL PaaS wouldn\'t work according to one of our developers.\n\nE) VPN w/ RADIUS\n\nNo website (our website is an online store handled by our marketing team and is separate from our infrastrcture) but we do use Sharepoint 2013 as our intranet.\n\nOBJECTIVE:  Our executive team wants to see the first workload/service up and running by end of March.  Ideally they want to see some ""benefit"" to migrating to the cloud.  This is not a requirement however, but it would be ideal.\n\nI have done an Azure migrate assessment and everything checks out OK.  The vnet is up and running and connected to our onprem via Ipsec S2S VPN.  I\'ve migrated test servers into Azure successfully using Veeam.  I have also gotten Azure Files to use NTFS permissions from our on prem domain controller\n\nMy question is, given that we do not have too many workloads/services to migrate, given the scenario above, what order would you migrate the above workloads/services?\n\nI\'m thinking the first workload/service I should move is to spin up a new Domain Controller because we plan on having VMs in Azure but will also need an onprem DC for group policy and logging in at the office.  \n\nAny roadblocks you might see migrating workloads over a year period with some services being on-prem and some in Azure?'",General,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/l0y1sl/planning_to_migrate_to_azurewhich_workloads_make/'

It has been on Windows Server 2012 R2 since 2014, so the process wasn\'t seamless, but (I think) I\'m nearly there!\n\nWe are a very simple company technology-wise, so we opted to go the OneDrive route for file sharing, have no crucial GPOs, and I plan on managing everything else in Azure AD. We\'ve had Azure AD Connect running on the on-prem for a few years.\n\nI have...\n\n* Migrated all the files to Sharepoint, and everyone\'s on OneDrive. (This is working great!)\n* All the company\'s devices on Windows 10, and recognizing Azure AD.\n* All the company\'s devices connected to InTune in the same Azure endpoint.\n\nThe last thing I have outstanding is decommissioning the on-prem server/AD. I am at the point where I believe my next step is to remove the AD sync function in Azure AD Connect on the on-prem, and I believe at that point the user accounts in Azure AD should switch over to ""cloud-only"" accounts. From there, I can just... turn off the on-prem for good?\n\nThe questions I have:\n\n1. Is that true? I just turn off the AD sync and they flip over to cloud-only?\n2. Is there a delay of anyone being able to log in to anything O365 or Windows-related? I am reading about this, but can\'t tell if it specifically applies to what I\'m doing here.\n\nIf it sounds like I dropped the ball anywhere else, please don\'t hesitate to let me know, but so far the OneDrive/Sharepoint setup and Azure AD has worked great!\n\nThanks in advance for your help.'",Technical Question,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/l0utaq/flipping_onprem_ad_accounts_over_to_azure_ad/'

b'Alternative to RMM software',"b'Hey All,\n\nI have been using Atera RMM tool for a while and although there are a lot of mixed reviews online I actually liked it. But since we are migrating to using only Microsoft 365 products I am searching for a way to accomplish some of the things in an Azure environment that I used a lot in Atera.\n\nPlease bare with me as I am still exploring the full capabilities and feature set of the stack. \n\nI used Atera to do software installations and patch management mostly on the clients not really on the servers. So managing the apps and installing apps on the go would be necessary. Atera also had an agent utility which allowed the admin (me) to login on the user\xe2\x80\x99s laptop without having to know the password and without the user\xe2\x80\x99s interaction. This was awesome for support. It had the ability to open event log, cmd, task manager, powershell without having to login. They opened in the browser which was a great plus. \n\nAre these features available in any tool of Microsoft 365? Perhaps in Endpoint Manager?\n\nAt the moment we buy laptops that come pre installed with W10 Pro but also with a lot of bloatware. I suppose Intune/autopilot will come in handy here and will be able to deploy a system from scratch? \n\nThank you for your help and information!'",Management and Goverance,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/l014iz/alternative_to_rmm_software/'

In order for this to work a resource be it VM, App Service, MySQL etc. needs to be able to resolve to a private endpoint to be able to upload the logs. While I can see perfectly fine how this will work with VM's (pretty much the same way as with any other private endpoint) and to some level with App Service  through the option  to route all Outgoing traffic through the VNET I can't understand how services like Managed MySQL / SQL / Storage Account etc etc. are meant to take advantage of this if we're not able to route outgoing traffic from these (no that we even have capability to initiate it) through the VNET.\n\nThanks""",General,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/l012x3/azure_monitor_private_link_scope_is_this_pretty/'

b'Mimecast supply-chain attack. Auditing/understanding Azure AD App Registration/Service Principal use',"b""So my org uses Mimecast, which is a email security platform. We had an Azure App Registration setup that allows Mimecast to backup our O365 mailboxes. The App Registration config allows read rights to our Exchange Online tenant. In the authentcation config we uploaded a certificate supplied by Mimecast. An attacker stole this certificate from Mimecast as per [https://threatpost.com/mimecast-certificate-microsoft-supply-chain-attack/162965/](https://threatpost.com/mimecast-certificate-microsoft-supply-chain-attack/162965/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMimecast are not divulging at lot of information at this point. They have told customers to expect a more detailed update this week; so far we have just been told to delete and recreate the App Registration. \n\n1) Am I correct in thinking that an attacker with the certificate could read our org's Exchange Online data?

I have been recently helping my team out with a project to migrate off our current STS (ADFS) password reset site over to AzureAD (most likely with Azure SSPR) for users.\n\nHowever, this brought up the question to go through everything we have set in our ADFS server (on-prem) and figure out if we can move ALL of them away from the ADFS server and use AzureAD instead for SSO? My question is, looking at the ADFS Management console I see a good handful of various ""Relying Party Trusts"" for things like [Lyna.com](https://Lyna.com), Eramba, Password State, and then some internal ones I\'m unsure of like, ""QATest 02, ServicesAuth\\_Staging, etc."".

b'Azure VPN: creating a S2S connection resource breaks P2S?',"b'I have an odd issue where my P2S VPN stops working as soon as I create a S2S connection resource.\n\nI have a newly provisioned virtual network with a virtual network gateway (Route-based VPN, SKU VpnGw1).  I configured point-to-site with a tunnel type of IKEv2/OpenVPN and certificate-based authentication. Then, using the ""download VPN client"" button, I confirmed that this works correctly from a Windows 10 client. So far so good.\n\nThen I attempted to add a S2S connection to a local gateway.  Default IPsec configuration, no BGP.  I confirmed that my Ubiquiti EdgeRouter can establish the tunnel, and clients attached to that router can reach an Azure VM that is on the vnet. Great!\n\nHowever, making that connection causes P2S to stop working.  My Windows client gets the error ""IKE authentication credentials are unacceptable (Error 13801)"".  So I removed the S2S connection entry from the virtual gateway, and P2S immediately works again.  Trying again, I re-added the S2S connection, and P2S stopped working.  In fact, it stops working if the S2S connection resource is merely present, even in a ""not connected"" state.\n\nIn Wireshark, I can see that having a S2S connection present causes Azure to change some fields in its IKE\\_SA\\_INIT response when I attempt a P2S connection.  It stops sending payload fields for IKEV2\\_FRAGMENTATION\\_SUPPORTED and the Certificate Request, even though I don\'t make any IPsec configuration changes.\n\nAny thoughts on what might be wrong here?  I\'m running in Azure Government, if that makes a difference.\n\nEDIT: Turns out if I download Azure VPN from the Microsoft Store on Windows 10, the VPN connection works even with a S2S connection present!  It only stops working if I remove Azure VPN and try to use the VPN client native to Windows 10.  It also seems to not work using the VPN client native to OS X, which is a problem for us since we\'re a mix of Windows and Mac users..'",Technical Question,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/kxhntj/azure_vpn_creating_a_s2s_connection_resource/'

b'Azure Files - Poor Performance',"b""Hi there,\n\nWe have a client of ours we're implementing Azure Files for, however we've been noticing that performance is remarkably slow. Most notably when opening up a document that's around 50Mb it takes a good 30 seconds for the document to open, while on the local file server it's within a second. Now obviously Azure Files will never be as fast as local, but ~30 seconds is remarkably slow. We've done a fair bit of troubleshooting including the following:\n\n- Created a temporary Premium azure Files setup and enabled SMB Multichanneling. This had no effect\n- Gone through all the potential issues listed here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-troubleshooting-files-performance\n- The client site has 600/600 speeds\n- I've tested accessing the same share from multiple different physical locations (at the office, at my house etc). All are equally slow.\n- I've tested accessing the same share from an Azure VM hosted in Canada Central, which is where the Storage Account is located, and it is a fair bit faster. Takes about 10-15 seconds to open the file.\n\nI'm suspecting this is due to geographical location (we're in Canada West, but we can't have a storage account here) but I want to see if anyone else has any ideas. It just seems bizarre to me that the performance is this bad if we're located in Canada West and the storage account is only in Canada Central.\n\nThanks for any help""",Technical Question,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/kwb31y/azure_files_poor_performance/'

b'Quick way of allowing > 128 connections with VPN GW1?',"b'TLDR: if you have SSTP supported in your Azure VPN Gateway, you\'re limited to 128 connections.

As people have been coming back from vacations and more kids now all doing remote learning in our area - everyone is working from home now.It took a while to figure out what was going on until the network guy showed me the connection report and I noticed it seem to hit a hard line at the top around 9:30am every morning.\n\nIt natively supports 128 connections (Included) with up to 250 at a cost. We ASSUMED it\'d just flex up to that 250 as needed and we\'d get the bill.\n\nBut no. (yes, I know, never assume.)\n\nSo we contacted sales and they told us to put in a support ticket, but we\'ve got about 30 people unable to connect or work now, and the turnaround time for support is 4-8 hours right now.\n\n***Is this a setting somewhere we can find? I searched the azure portal everywhere and cant seem to find it. does it REQUIRE tech support intervention to flip a switch?***\n\n\\---------------------------\n\n*Edit: adding this because google had no results for this error and would love to save other people some time:*\n\n*An operation attempted to exceed an implementation defined limit(You\'ve run out of concurrent connections on your Azure VPN)*  \n\n\n\\------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinal Update:   \n\n\nOnce we changed the tunnel type to just ""IKEv2"" and dropped SSTP everything has been rock solid. It doesn\'t LOOK like it caused connections to drop, and we didn\'t get any complaints when we made the switch. all the SKU\'s for azure\'s VPN services only support 128 SSTP connections - But it turns out even if you aren\'t USING SSTP, it\'ll restrict it to that if you just support it.

b'iothub question - help me analyze my window roller blinds',"b""Hi guys,\n\nI have bought automated window blinds and would like to geek out on them.\n\nSo far I have setup an IoTHub, the blinds connect and send their current position every minute (percentage open). I setup stream analytics to read these messages and then copy to data lake in AVRO format (just to keep the entire history, no use case here yet). I also setup a powerbi connector that show me my current percentage open, and a line chart of the last 24 hours.\n\nCool stuff! But here is my question\n\nI don't want the powerbi thing, I want to integrate it in a Django webapp I already have. How do I best do this? Insert everything in a SQL seems a bit like a bad solution, and would grow continuously, is there a better way (I realize SQL would work for my small use case ,but I want to learn the proper way)?\n\n I want to have the same 2 data items as in the powerbi dashboard (current state, and the data points for a linechart), but available as an API call (so reasonably fast response time, I can then poll it from my app to refresh). \n\nWhat would be the most 'Azure' solution to achieve this?\n\nThe reason I want to integrate with my Django app is because I call that app from a small webbrowser that doesn't really handle powerbi that well, its on a arduino.""",Internet of Things,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/kvfhso/iothub_question_help_me_analyze_my_window_roller/'

By this time the failover kicked in and secondary become active.

I saw Azure AD Connect which seemed to be it but when testing with it, all the guides online were for Express setup which only worked if I first made the 2019 server a domain controller.\n\nWhat I am trying to do if possible, is basically have the Microsoft 365 user accounts be accessible on this server.  We use one web based application that uses Active Directory for authentication, and then if I wanted to set up VPN or file server etc I figured it would be ideal having users authenticate with their Microsoft 365 account.  I just wanted to get clarification as the part I'm missing is does the 2019 on prem server need to be a domain controller itself first, or do I have to join it to the Azure AD domain somehow first?  Just not really clear how hybrid this is, as I don't really want the 2019 server to be a controller at all unless necessary.  I just wanted to be able to log into the server as a MS365 user or use those accounts for permissions and so on.\n\nAs a quick aside, I did test last night by making the 2019 server a controller and then used Azure AD Connect to set it up which seemed successful, but I don't see any MS365 accounts on the 2019 server or vice versa or any mention they are connected, other than when I formatted the 2019 machine to reinstall I got an email from Azure saying it's not connected anymore.\n\nThanks so much!""",Technical Question,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/kv4jiy/windows_server_2019_on_prem_i_want_it_to_use_user/'

b'Best practices for running internal CA and using Azure Key Vault?',"b'I\'m setting up some IT infrastructure for a small startup. Our infrastructure is completely cloud-based in Azure/O365. I am establishing an internal certificate authority, which we will use to issue certs for Azure VPN authentication and for internal HTTPS web-based tools. I\'ve done similar in the past using command-line openssl and keeping the root CA secret on a local computer. Instead, I\'d like to store the secrets and the certs in Azure Key Vault.\n\nI can generate a self-signed cert for the root CA in Key Vault. I can also create an endpoint certificate ""issued by a non-integrated CA"" and download a CSR. But I\'m not sure how to sign the request using the root CA secret in Key Vault.\n\nI could download the secret to a separate machine and then use openssl to do the signing, but that seems to defeat the point of keeping the root secret in Key Vault.

Bot App (app service)\n2. Bot Channels Registration \n3. Speech Service (Cognitive Services)\n\nI also have the Windows Voice Assistant Client for testing. What\'s interesting to me is that the client *only* needs the speech service subscription key, not the URL of my bot. From what I can piece together, I\'m guessing the flow is something like the following. Could someone confirm/elaborate/comment?\n\n1. Client sends audio/text to a common Speech Services endpoint, tagged with the subscription key. - **If this is true, what is this common, publicly exposed endpoint?** \n2. Speech Services knows that Bot Channels Registration is the registered recipient for the subscription key, so it sends its output to Bot Channels Registration/Bot Services\n3. Bot Channels Registration/Bot Services forwards the message to the Bot App\n4. Bot App processes and returns response to Bot Channels Registration/Bot Services\n5. Bot Channels Registration/Bot Services returns response to Speech Services\n6. Speech Services  returns response to the client\n\nOther questions:\n\n1. **Is the Bot Channels Registration the same thing as ""Bot Services""?

Our current setup looks like this:\n\n* 2 DCs (one physical, one virtual (VMware VM)\n   * The DCs both host DNS as well as DHCP\n* 1 WSUS server\n* 1 print server\n* 2 Certificate Authority servers\n\nI am mostly concerned about the DCs, to be honest. I would imagine that I can simply build a pair of new DCs in Azure as VMs and install the DNS role on them? Although, from some research it seems like DHCP is NOT supported on an Azure DC?\n\nSo, my questions so far are:\n\n1. How do you handle DHCP for this domain if ALL of your infrastructure is going to be in Azure? Or would you need to keep some VMs on-prem, in this case a DHCP server for the domain?\n2.

"b""Is it sensible to be registering a 'social login' for each of our clients' external IdPs in Azure AD B2C?""","b""Hello folks,\n\nMy company has been using B2C for about a year, primarily to allow our customers to use their existing enterprise accounts to access our applications. When we onboard our clients, we register their company IdP as a ClaimsProvider in our B2C instance. We're using custom policies because some of these IdPs are SAML-based. Essentially, we have a bunch of these IdPs which basically behave like social logins, but we don't display them on the SSO page because most users will only ever have an association with one external IdP--that of their own company.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this rule. Some external users have local accounts and some of our internal users have multiple external identities. To understand how this works, take a look at the [default UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/media/customize-ui-with-html/html-content-merging.png). In our custom UI, we've removed the social login section (everything above 'Sign in with your existing account') and hide the password field unless the user is logging in with a local account. When a user enters their email, they are redirected to their IdP. For a user with multiple identities, they are allowed to choose from a dialog.\n\nMy question is, is this the best way to handle this situation? We moved to B2C last year and our implementation is pretty much the result of heavy trial and error since proper documentation, especially for custom policies, is...uh...something to be desired.""",Azure Active Directory,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/krsetk/is_it_sensible_to_be_registering_a_social_login/'

b'Preparation Tips for Microsoft Azure Administrator AZ-104',"b' \n\n## Preparation Tips For The AZ-104 Exam\n\n1. I prepared for around 2 hours each day and on the weekend around 4 hours. Overall it took me around a month and a half to complete all the course and the labs.\n2. Create a free account with\xc2\xa0Azure\xc2\xa0to get the $100, create your own\xc2\xa0subscription\xc2\xa0and use it for your labs. This is a must to get familiar with the\xc2\xa0Service\xc2\xa0offered by Azure.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n3. I would highly recommend getting familiar with the syntax of both the\xc2\xa0Azure\xc2\xa0CLI and AZ Powershell. If you\xe2\x80\x99re not too familiar with it, start with the basics like create a resource group, then a subnet, a VM and so on. If you do for few times, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have the\xc2\xa0basis\xc2\xa0of the commands nailed down.\n4. Some of the questions are lengthy and tricky. You need to understand possible dependencies and where to spot them to be able to answer questions quickly.\n5. My weakest area was \xe2\x80\x9cConfigure and manage virtual networking\xe2\x80\x9d. I would highly recommend creating Virtual Network (VNET), subnets, Network Security Group (NSG), Virtual Machine (VM), test RDP, install webserver, create allow/deny rules etc to make yourself familiar with the entire Azure VNET ecosystem.\xc2\xa0\n6. Another important lab is around You can use Azure Web App in your free account and play around with it. Expect to see multiple questions there.\n7. On the official Azure link, it suggests buying official practice test cost of which is $100. I would\xc2\xa0NOT\xc2\xa0recommend buying that.\n8. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of Kubernetes questions in the exam but I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard some of my friends get not so easy questions there.\n9. Another important topic is the Azure Active Directory. Check the list of topics below in the Official Exam Guide. I must have received at least 6-7 questions there.\n10. Some of the questions are lengthy and tricky. I would recommend to check them to be revisited at the end. If not sure of an answer, use the elimination process to get rid of options that are not applicable before making a guess.\n11. Azure Documentation has a lot of tutorials and quickstarts. While you do not need to go through all the tutorials but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt if you really want to understand the Azure Cloud in depth.\n\n As per Microsoft, Azure Administrator AZ-104 exam will be updated on **January 27, 2021**.

Imagine I have simply launched a VM (no scale set) in the Azure cloud and hosted an application on it. What will happen in the scenario if my server dies due to traffic overload?\n\n\\- Will it restart again automatically when the traffic goes down? And, the application will work again as normal?\n\n2. Due to some hardware failure or disaster, if Azure stops my VM, will it automatically replicate the VM and the application to another fault domain/AZ and run it without me doing anything?\n\n3. If I have an application that I want to host on VMs and I launch two VMs in two AZs for high availability, do I need to manually deploy the same app on both VMs?\n\nPlease share your thoughts.'",Technical Question,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/krf442/how_azure_ensure_high_availability_az900/'

b'Migrating an entire EC2 instance running SQL server to Azure as a VM',"b'Please note the following was done with a test instance, not a production workload.\n\nI have an EC2 instance in AWS created from a Windows Server 2012 R2 SQL Server 2016 Standard image. Currently compute cost as well as SQL server license cost is included in the monthly bill. I used Azure Migrate to move the entire EC2 instance over to Azure. I did not use the database migration component of Azure migrate I instead used the option to lift and shift the entire EC2 instance to Azure. I have some other applications aside from SQL server that are running on the EC2 instance which I wanted carried over to Azure which is why I selected that method. Everything appears to be functioning now that the replication is complete and I\'m RDP\'d into the VM in Azure. I have a few questions:\n\n1) Is this an acceptable approach insofaras am I risking some kind of corruption to the database by moving the entire VM as opposed to using the dedicated database migration options of Azure Migrate (It\'s not clear to me if this kind of move is application consistent insofar as if it pushes any pending I/O to disk prior to the final replication)?\n\n2) If the way I went about it is alright than now that the VM is running in Azure how do I become compliant with SQL Server Licensing requirements? I attempted to do this by going into the subscription the VM resides in, select Resource providers and then register the  **Microsoft.SqlVirtualMachine** provider.

b'Azure remote VM powershell execution',"b""I've been working with Azure for 4-5 years now, have a ton of certifications, but I have some specific questions about remotely joining a VM to a managed domain.\n\nI currently have been playing with a Powershell script that uses Invoke-AzVMCommand to execute a PS script block on the specific VM.  The script block will use a variety of parameters, create a folder on an Azure file share, store an encrypted password in the file share, copy the encryped password to the vm, decrypt the password, then use it to join the VM to the domain.  It feels a lot like rudimentary Powershell DSC and I'm just wondering if there's an easier way with Azure tools?  This method relies on PS Remoting and for security reasons, this may not always be possible.\n\nThe reason I want to get to the bottom of this is because I'd like to work on creating a web app where I can plug in some parameters to an Azure tenant and subscription, domain name, vm names, etc, and execute a fully automated managed domain creation, VM creation, and VM join.

b'CISA sparrow.ps1',"b'I have ran [Sparrow.ps1](https://github.com/cisagov/Sparrow) and have obtained the results.  I am reaching out to all to try and learn more about the results.  Trying to understand what some of it means and where to look.  How to use the tool and the data it provides. Just trying to learn here.\n\n***TLDR;*** *I need to take this data and try and do some due diligence.  Address changes we need to make and remediate anything that has happened. The Sparrow.PS1 Script is insightful but it is only tool that output\'s information and I need to be able to interpret this information for it to be useful. Any insight or perspective would be helpful.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne question I have is the following statement on the github page: ***To check for the MailItemsAccessed Operation, your tenant organization requires an Office 365 or Microsoft 365 E5/G5 license.***\n\nIn my org we do not have E5 licenses.  But if I read this I take it to mean exactly what it says.  But I believe it is a little unclear.  Around line 124 we see Sparrow.ps1 ask:\n\n`$LicenseQuestion = Read-Host \'Do you have an Office 365/Microsoft 365 E5/G5 license? Y/N\'`\n\nThen around line 129 we see it ask:\n\n`$AppIdQuestion = Read-Host \'Would you like to investigate a certain application? Y/N\'`\n\nIf we continue to look where these variables are used we see it referenced only in Get-UALData lines 210 through 218:\n\n`If ($AppIdInvestigation -eq ""Yes""){`\n\n`If ($LicenseAnswer -eq ""Yes""){`\n\n`#Searches for the AppID to see if it accessed mail items.`\n\n`Write-Verbose ""Searching for $SusAppId in the MailItemsAccessed operation in the UAL.""`\n\n`$SusMailItems = Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate $StartDate -EndDate $EndDate -Operations ""MailItemsAccessed"" -ResultSize 5000 -FreeText $SusAppId -Verbose | Select-Object -ExpandProperty AuditData | Convertfrom-Json`\n\n`#You can modify the resultant CSV output by changing the -CsvName parameter`\n\n`#By default, it will show up as MailItems_Operations_Export.csv`\n\n`Export-UALData -ExportDir $ExportDir -UALInput $SusMailItems -CsvName ""MailItems_Operations_Export"" -WorkloadType ""EXO""`\n\n`}...`\n\nSo it looks like it would export another CSV for us.  But this only occurs if you choose *""Yes""* to the APPID Investigation.\n\nMy thoughts on this:\n\n* I only need an E5 license if I wish to search on a specific AppID\n   * to be clear is the E5 only required for the account running the sparrow.ps1 (or do all mailboxes need it? - I suspect latter)\n* So when would I want to search a specific APPID?\n   * would it be after I run a first pass and start seeing entries of certain APPID\'s allowing me to dig deeper?\n   * Otherwise how would I know what APPID to search unless I have some sort of suspicion or curiosity on a specific APP\n\nSo my only comment here is based on my limited understanding I don\'t know what I am looking for or simply I am only looking for signs of bad actors, but am not sure what those signs are yet. So How would I know the APPID.\n\nWithout doing an APPID investigation the script itself spits out the following CSV\'s.:\n\n**ApplicationGraphPermissions.csv**\n\n* Pretty simple an audit of apps that displays Graph Permissions:\n* goto [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) |Azure Active Directory | APP Registrations  | Enterprise Applications -> under *Application Type* selet *All Applications*\n* Get-AzureADApplication -SearchString $yourappname\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**AppRoleAssignment\\_Operations\\_Export.csv**\n\n* Presumably this is a log of users or other actors(apps or whatever) signing themselves roles to an app.  If anyone can expand on this or clarify please do.

b'Directory Confusion',"b""I'm new to Azure and have a question about a Blazor Server app I'm trying to migrate to Azure.\n\nI have two directories.  One tied to my Microsoft login email, which is my main account that I've had for a long time even though I haven't used it, and another tied to (I believe) a new project I'm working on.  I'm a bit confused as to what's going on here with these two directories.\n\nThe first directory, the one tied to my  email, has a resource group I created for the project.  The second directory does not have any resource groups.\n\nIn the resource group I have two resources:  a key vault and a Azure AD B2C tenant.  The name of the tenant is the same as the domain(?) name of the second directory.  In other words, [example.onmicrosoft.com](https://example.onmicrosoft.com). The first directory's domain is [myemail.onmicrosoft.com](https://myemail.onmicrosoft.com).  This first domain shows up as a resource (a B2C tenant) in my resource group in the first directory.\n\nThe issue I've run into is that the first directory appears to not have any app registrations under Azure AD B2C.  While the second directory has no resources, it does have my app registered under it in Azure AD B2C!\n\nIs this configuration by design or did I screw something up?\n\nThank you!""",Technical Question,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/klxzpb/directory_confusion/'

b'Best way to publish NuGet package for my specific use-case?',"b""I work on a team that needs to publish a couple NuGet packages for another team. The team that will be consuming our packages uses an artifact feed on Azure DevOps for all their deployments. My team has no experience with Azure DevOps or .NET in general, but we did get some Azure accounts set up with access to the artifact feed. I am looking for the most practical way to set up CI/CD for this scenario.\n\nI would like to deliver our NuGet packages using GitHub Actions if possible. [This workflow](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-nuget) seems like it should suit my needs. However, when I try to use it to publish to the Azure Artifact feed, I get a response of 401 Unauthorized. I think it might be related to the lack of a credential helper, but I am not sure. When I deploy NuGet packages manually from my Macbook, I have only been successful when using the credential provider.\n\nIs there a way to access the Azure feed without using a credential provider tool (like when publishing from a GitHub Action)? Am I going about this the right way? Or do you have a different suggestion? Is it really necessary to publish to the other team's Azure artifact feed at all, or would it be easier to just publish a GitHub artifact and have them pull it in? Ideally, I want to accomplish this task with minimal involvement in Azure DevOps.

I was able to do this for NSGs using a deny effect and then not enforcing it, basically just using it as an audit tool so I can go through and remediate (by removing the rule manually) until my compliance on the assignment shows 100%.\n\nMy issue is, the Azure SQL Firewall syntax (is that what you\'d call it) doesn\'t seem to be working like I think it should. I\'ve pasted my NSG definition below (which might be helpful to anyone looking to do the same!. I\'m certainly no JSON expert, and it took me a lot of research to write this one, but when I try to use the same type of format to write the Azure SQL one with StartIP and EndIP, the editor always shows that any of the rule properties aren\'t an option.\n\nI\'m using  Microsoft.Sql/servers/firewallRules and trying to hit\n\n     properties"": {\n            ""startIpAddress"": ""xxx"",\n            ""endIpAddress"": ""xxx""\n\nIs anyone able to point me in the right direction?

b'Trouble reaching azure database for mysql from aks',"b""First of all, merry christmas! Hope you all have a good one despite the circumstances.\n\nYesterday I encountered a problem that I can't wrap my head around. Maybe there are some ideas here. I have deployed a container to aks, that container should connect to an azure database for mysql. However, this doesn't work.\n\nI've set up a service endpoint connecting aks to the mysql instance. The logs from the pod indicate that my application is waiting for the database to come up. When I start a bash shell from my pod, I can't resolve the mysql database dns record.\n\nWhat am I missing here? I know the aks deloyment creates a seperate resource group with infrastructure components. That resource group (with the prefix MC), contains a vnet with multiple subnets. I set up the service endpoint from one of those subnets (the one that I think houses my nodes). The mysql instance is in the same resource group as the my aks.\n\nDid I choose the wrong subnet? Or should I set up the service endpoint somewhere differently entirely?""",Technical Question,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/kjx9nf/trouble_reaching_azure_database_for_mysql_from_aks/'
"b""If I'm using Azure Firewall Can I Stop Using NSGs?""","b""Thinking to use Azure Firewall in a way that would completely invalidate the need for NSGs. Tell me if I'm wrong here. \n\nI could use UDRs to route all internal subnet traffic across all VNET's through that firewall. If I understood correctly this would allow me to manage all the firewall rules in one place rather than use individual NSGs. As I build more in Azure, I can track all these rules appending them to a Firewall Terraform module and also pipe firewall logs to Splunk at some point  (gotta look into how to do this). \n\nAzure Firewall is a basic firewall that I'd have dealing with internal traffic. It has some more features but they're not super sophisticated IPS/IDS/Malware-analysis type of stuff. If it was traffic from the outside it would come through an Azure Application Gateway first. \n\nBefore going to third party NVA's which are more complex to set up and cost more, would this be a decent idea?

b'Top 2020 Trends for Azure. Thoughts?',"b""Hey All,\n\nI've been thinking a lot about the different cloud and dev trends throughout 2020. I came up with five that I think are the most relevant and the most eye-opening.\n\nThe first is GitHub Codespaces. The more we write code, the more we need a centralized location to write the code. For example, let's say there are 5 devs on a team that are writing code. Each dev (perhaps) has a different workstation setup. If they don't have the same extensions and tools as everyone else, there could be unknown issues that you can't really prepare for.\n\nThe second is Azure Arc, specifically Azure Arc for Kubernetes. Although the tech, in general, is really cool, I think it shows that Microsoft is starting to think about on-prem and hybrid again. It's pretty clear that at least not anytime soon, on-prem isn't going away. Because of that, why not manage the on-prem stuff in Azure as well?  \n\nThe third is infrastructure-as-software. With AWS CDK, Hashicorp CDK, and Pulumi, we're starting to see a HUGE trend in creating and managing cloud services with a general-purpose programming language (Go, JavaScript, etc.)\n\nThe fourth is something that we've been seeing for a while, but it's because extremely apparent this year - coding for sysadmins and infrastructure engineers. I think we're going to see an upward trend that everyone will be coding in some way or another\n\nFinally, I love the specialty and career-driven certifications that we're seeing. I've never been a huge certification guy myself, but I'm definitely more interested now that most Azure and AWS certs are career-focused.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? What are your top five trends you saw that are worth noting?\n\nIf you're interested, I created a short 5-minute video on the topics above. Let me know your thoughts :)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nrPXoUV0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4nrPXoUV0w)""",General,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/kjl29i/top_2020_trends_for_azure_thoughts/'

Can I get to another peered VNet?',"b""Hello-\n\nI have a site to site VPN that is up and happy between a customer's on-prem firewall and their Azure tenant.  This VPN goes into a virtual network (VNet A).  \n\nThe tenant has another virtual network (VNet B).  Due to a legacy connection that needs to be maintained for now, this VNet has a Virtual Network Gateway (VNGW) in IKE v1/policy route mode that connects to a different firewall device.\n\nBecause the VNGW on VNet B is in IKE v1/policy route mode, I cannot add additional connections, nor create a new VNGW that ties into the same subnet.\n\nBoth VNets are in the same region/tenant/resource group\n\nWhat I'm trying to accomplish:   Can I get the on-prem traffic from the VPN that goes into VNet A to talk to VNet B?  \n\nIt seems like I could potentially peer the two VNets/subnets together so the VNets know that they can talk to each other, but I'm unsure of how (or if it's possible in the first place) I would change the VNGW/VPN settings on VNet A and the on-prem firewall to be aware of the other subnet in VNet B.\n\nHopefully this makes sense.

b'I passed the Az-104 Exam in a rush',"b'Hey Guys, I just finished the Exam and even though I was pretty scared because the Test itself was actually pretty hard. I managed to pass with 800 Points. I am actually working as an IT-Consultant for about a year now in a company and my main focus is Azure Infrastructures etc.\n\nWe need to do certifications to keep our Partner Status, however the required certificate for me has been decided at the end of November. Count in a lot of customer projects that needs to get completed before vacation time hits and you can guess that i had barely any time to prepare for the exam. So I used the Scott Duffy Udemy Course and Practise Exams from Whizlabs. Some Things I can tell you from my experience:\n\n\\- neither Udemy nor Whizlabs Practise Exams cover all you need to know to pass this exam. The Udemy course actually gave me some good hints on where to dive in and find more stuff that i would need to know about. During the Exam about half of the questions were questions i didn\'t see before. \n\n\\- I had an Azure Subscription with monthly 130\xe2\x82\xac, so I had a playfield to test stuff with. However I used it to simulate scenarios i repeatedly failed during practise exams, especially the usual ""can you move xy to yx with read-only lock on RG/Resource"" etc... Go and test it, its kinda annoying but easy once you fully understand the rules\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- A lot of questions are really tricky and require proper and precise reading of the question. however I still recommend you to learn how to read these questions (read the question first, then check the resources. BARE IN MIND THOUGH: You need to understand possible dependencies and where to spot them to be able to do that!!) If you are able to do that, you can save a lot of time for reviewing stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- I wouldn\'t recommend rushing this certificate if you don\'t have hands-on experience with the platform. it changes daily and a lot of the questions asked are really mean and annoying... but actually pretty accurate and realistic scenarios a customer could ask you..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- I Highly recommend understanding CLI and Powershell, not only for the exam, it will help you on the job a lot in the future\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther than that, feel free to ask me if you have any questions or tips.\n\nStay Safe!'",Exam / Certification,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/kif9m8/i_passed_the_az104_exam_in_a_rush/'

b'Where can I quickly learn about best practices for Azure Servicebus/event driven patterns?',"b'Yesterday I found out that I have to take lead on an ETL project involving Azure Servicebus in the start of January that I haven\'t been involved in designing. Essentially it comes down to grabbing product data updates from a topic, and loading them into two or three different databases.  Supposedly we\'ll set up some .NET Core worker applications running Hangfire(I\'m not exactly sure how Hangfire actually fits into this. I have experience with it, but can\'t see it making sense in this scenario) as consumers.\n\nThere are a number of important criteria such as that updates to any product must be loaded in order(supposedly will come as a session?). \n\nThere\'s apparently been a lot of debate whether the whole products data or only a delta will be put in each event or whether it should simply be an event with an ID for a product saying: ""This is updated, fetch it from our REST API). I\'m not sure what the various consequences of each approach is. I\'m usually not a fan of deltas, but I can of course see that it\'s more efficient in terms of data footprint.\n\nThere\'s also issues of resiliency. When does something go on the dead letter queue, who should handle those messages, when should the consumer simply engage a circuitbreaker(for example if the product database is down?).\n\nI\'m not sure what else I have to look out for. I don\'t know what the common patterns involving what\'s essentially pub/sub or event driven design(?) are called or what good resources for reading about them are. I\'m happy to read books, articles etc. Usually I prefer books, because they give a better depth of understanding.\n\nI\'m self-isolating over Christmas, so I would spend some time preparing for this, as I assume the biggest issue is going to be that none of us at the company have tried implementing a flow like this before.'",Technical Question,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/kg6h6g/where_can_i_quickly_learn_about_best_practices/'

b'Which Azure services for this simple application?',"b""I want to create a very simple game application for two purposes:\n\n1. A learning exercise for Azure services.\n2. The game might be fun to play with family and a few friends (I have no intention of making it public).\n\nI actually created a very similar game using Amazon Web Services, it used an Elastic Beanstalk instance, redis cache for data persistence between sessions and SignalR for seamless UI updates on the client browsers. I used the cheapest instance available and I would start and stop the instance as needed for when I wanted to play the game, and I used some hosted redis cache service that had a free tier for those who had super low utilisation (which was more than enough for the purpose). So the redis cache didn't cost anything. Overall, the running costs were almost zero.\n\nI know want to create a similar game within Azure but this time I'd like to go down the Serverless route. The pay for what you use plan seems perfect as I wouldn't have to start and stop resources and the costs would also be next to nothing. I literally want the monthly costs to be pennies.\n\nThe game is not really demanding but the basics are:\n\n1. Players use a web browser for their client.\n2. Webpage updates without a refresh (SignalR was good so happy to use this again).\n3. On the backend side, I only need to store a very small amount of data (a few KB at most) and even this data is only during an active game, once a game has ended the data can be deleted.\n\nIn terms of services, I was thinking of using:\n\n1. Azure Functions\n2. Azure SignalR server\n3. Cosmos DB Serverless ([https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/serverless](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/serverless))\n\nThoughts and suggestions, should I consider anything else?""",General,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/kf8uoq/which_azure_services_for_this_simple_application/'

"b'Migrating to M365, then Azure'","b""Hopefully someone understands the level of ignorance I have - I'm just stuck at these concepts and can't find answers because I'm probably not asking the right questions.\n\nBeen trying to figure this one out for a while and am not getting anywhere. Hopefully someone has an opinion:\n\nWe're currently running AD, some hosting sites and on prem exchange in our office. This worked well pre-covid, but now everyone is remote and VPNs to firewall then RDP to their workstations.\n\nWe're going to migrate to M365 and do hybrid AD for phase 1. We also want to then use M365 AD SSO capabilities for third party services.\n\nFor Phase 2, workstations will be sent home and people will access resources in our physical office. This changes the traffic dynamic, i.e. all data is now sent over VPN instead of basically everything being local to our network.\n\nPhase 3 will be moving our entire office to Azure.\n\nSo, the questions are:\n\n- Where along this line is the best place to start VPNing into Azure instead of our local office? Traffic would increase for the short term, but that's Ok. \n\n- Any issues with latency?\n\n- When would we need an Azure firewall? \n\n- I'm still confused about using Azure and not needing a firewall. Is it only when we need to create a virtual network there? I assume a VN is not needed when we're just doing M365 and hybrid AD.\n\nTIA\n\n[UPDATE]\nThanks, everyone.

b'Azure AFS Share Permissions Not Working As Expected',"b'Hi All,\n\nI am having a problem with share and NTFS permissions for AFS shares. I can access the created shares both by user and group membership, through an AD joined file share server/object (AD DS).  I am assigning the appropriate SMB built-in IAM group to the shares in question and the behaviour appears as expected. For example, assigning the user or group Storage File Data SMB Share Reader allows the user/group to only read but not write/create or delete as expected. Likewise when assigning the Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor, the user can create/write, delete as expected.\n\nThe issue is with the NTFS rights. They do not appear to be working as intended. Maybe I am old school, but my practice over the last 20 years since Active Directory in Windows 2000, is I almost always assign Full Control at the Share level to the Everyone group and always use NTFS to restrict from there.\n\nHowever in this case, say I assign the user/group Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor role, then I want to use NTFS to restrict access to only read / list access. The user/group continues to be able to create, delete. It it almost as if the Share rights are overriding the NTFS permissions. I want to be able to control permissions with the granularity of NTFS using the regular Security tab, I do not want to have to be limited to and use only the 3 built-in Azure IAM groups for securing access to shares.\n\nI am sure I am simply doing something wrong here but would really appreciate some guidance.'",Technical Question,b'https://www.reddit.com/r/AZURE/comments/k9ze83/azure_afs_share_permissions_not_working_as/'
